🔐 Cipher Algorithms in Python

This project implements classical encryption algorithms in Python. A simple menu-based interface (like a switch-case system) allows users to select a cipher and encrypt their message interactively.

- Caesar Cipher  
- Hill Cipher  
- Polyalphabetic Cipher  
- Polygram Substitution  
- Monoalphabetic Cipher  
- Amsco Cipher

 ⚙️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository or download the `.py` file.
3. Install required dependencies (only NumPy is required):
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python cipher_algorithms.py
Follow the on-screen prompts:

yaml

Edit
Select a cipher:
1. Caesar Cipher
2. Hill Cipher
...
Enter your choice: 1
Enter plaintext: HELLO
Enter shift value: 3
Encrypted text: KHOOR
📌 Notes
This is an educational project showcasing how classical encryption methods work.

Not suitable for real-world cryptographic use.

Decryption functions can be added similarly.
